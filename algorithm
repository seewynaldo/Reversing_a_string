Take a string as an input.
Declare two variables pointing to the first and last index of the string.
Swap the characters at their places and increment variables pointing to first character and decrement variable pointing to last character.
Do it until the first variable is less than the second one
Print the reversed string(could add another condition to check if it's a pallindrome or not by just checking the reversed string with the original one)
End the program
